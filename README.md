• The graph above shows the number of bikes used and the birth years of the users most of which are in their thirties.
• Summary: 
• With the graph above we can conclude a few things. Most of the Citi bike users are males in their 30’s which use them between the hours of 4pm to 7pm and 7am to 9am i.e when people get on and off work/ school. This would be useful as investor would be interested in which groups we would market to (male 30’s) and what promotions the company could provide promotions for peak times. Other graphs that would be useful would be those mapping start and stop destinations which would  predicted the best locations for the bike sharing app.
